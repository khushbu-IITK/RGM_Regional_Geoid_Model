**Description**
 
This project is an attempt to develop Regional Geoid Model using **Airborne Gravity data**. Here the area of Interest is Texas, USA, having the extent between **102째 E to 96째 E & 30째 N to 33째 N**.

-Main Data Source: The AirBorne gravity data is downloaded from GRAV-D data products.

- The approach used for gravity modelling is remove-restore approach.

**About Code Files**

- Use the Main_.m file for final execution, all other added files will be needed in the execution of "Main_.m" file.
- For better understanding read the report attached.
